# Let's get Hooked

# 01. What is the difference between `Named Export`, `Default export` and `*` as export?

### Example of `Named export:`

```
// ðŸ“‚ math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// ðŸ“‚ main.js
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

const result1 = add(5, 3); // result1 will be 8
const result2 = subtract(10, 4); // result2 will be 6
```

### Example of `Default export:`

```
// ðŸ“‚ math.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export default add;

// ðŸ“‚ main.js
import myAddFunction from './math.js';
const result = myAddFunction(5, 10); // This will call the add function from math.js and store the result in the 'result' variable.

```

### When there are multiple Named exports in a module all of them can be imported using a single statement given below:

```
import * as math from 'math';
```

# 02. What is the importance of config.js file?

`config.js` file may contain the information that is used by multiple components or static data is generally placed in the `config.js` file.

# 03. What are React Hooks?

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
<br>
There are 3 rules for hooks:<br>

<ul>
<li>Hooks can only be called inside React function components.</li>
<li>Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.</li>
<li>Hooks cannot be conditional.</li>
</ul>

# 04. Why do we need a useState Hook?

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.<br>
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.<br>It is used to create a local variable that is used to track the state in a function component.

```
// importing useState Hook from react
import {useState} from 'react'

// destructuring
const [searchInp, setSearchInp] = useState("DefaultSearchValue")

// setSearchInp is used to change the value of searchInp.
```
