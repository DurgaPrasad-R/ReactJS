# 6. Exploring the World

# 01. What is a Microservice?

`Microservices` also known as the microservice architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:<br>

- Independently deployable
- Loosely coupled
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team

# 02. What is Monolith architecture?

A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base.This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming<br>

# 03. What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?

```
Cons of Monolithic architecture:
    1. Slower development speed
    2. Scalability
    3. Reliability
    4. Barrier to technology adoption
    5. Lack of flexibility
```

Depending on the application the user/ an organization can choose either Monolithic architecture or Microservice architecture.

```
Cons of Microservice architecture:
    1. Exponential infrastructure costs
    2. Debugging challenges
    3. Lack of standardization
    4. Lack of clear ownership
    5. Development sprawl
```

# 03. Why do we need a useEffect Hook?

`What does useEffect do?:` By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.<br>

The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects(effects => functions at the end) in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.<br>
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

````
    useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)```
````

if no `dependency` is passed => runs on every render.
if [] is passed as dependency => runs only on initial render.
if [props, state] is passed as dependency => runs on initial render and whenever there is a change in even one of the dependencies.

# 04. What is Optional Chaining?

The optional chaining (`?.`) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null, the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

# 05. What is Shimmer UI?

A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesn’t contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and shapes of the content that will eventually appear. It uses a gradient animation that creates a shimmering effect over the placeholders, giving the user a sense of motion and progress.<br>
A shimmer UI has many benefits over traditional loading indicators:

- It improves the perceived performance of the app by making it seem faster and more responsive.
- It reduces the cognitive load on the user by providing visual cues about the type and structure of the content that is being loaded.
- It eliminates surprises and confusion by showing a consistent and predictable UI before and after loading.
- It enhances the aesthetic appeal and user satisfaction by creating a smooth and elegant transition from loading to loaded.

# 06. What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?

Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.
Statements create side effects to be useful, while expressions are values or execute to values.Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution. For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not.

# 07. What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example

In React, conditional rendering is the process of displaying different content based on certain conditions or states. It allows you to create dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to changes in data and user interactions. In this process, you can use conditional statements to decide what content should be rendered.

```
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <h1>Welcome back!</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Please sign up.</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# 08. What is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. (Remember what we did to swiggy's api)

# 09. What is async and await?

An async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object. Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new Promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function.
<br>
Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code.

# 10. What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants()?

`data.json()` returns a Promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. To make it work like a synchronous function await is called which stops the execution until data.json() is executed completely.
