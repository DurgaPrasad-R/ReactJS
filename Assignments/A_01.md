# 01. What is Emmet?
Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. <br>
Abbreviations are the heart of the Emmet toolkit: these special expressions are parsed in runtime and <br>
transformed into structured code block <br>
Example:<br>
    #page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li\*5>a{Item $}<br>
The above example can be transformed into:<br>
    div id="page"<br>
        div class="logo"/div<br>
        ul id="navigation"<br>
            li a href=""Item 1 /a /li<br>
            li a href=""Item 2 /a /li<br>
            li a href="" Item 3 /a /li<br>
            li a href="" Item 4 /a /li<br>
            li a href=""Item 5 /a /li<br>
        /ul<br>
    /div<br>
Thus the use of Emmet is to create a large block of code with a single keystroke.<br>
# 02.  Difference between a Library and Framework
<ol>
<li>Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.</li>
<li>A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.</li>
<li>The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.</li>
