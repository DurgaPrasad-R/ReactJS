# 07. Finding the Path

# 01.What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples

There are multiple ways to add images into your app. Here are some common methods:

1. Importing Images Directly:
   You can import images directly into your React components and use them as local variables

```
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Import the image

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

2. Using Public Folder:
   Place your images in the public folder and reference them directly in your components.

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

3. Dynamic Import:
   Load images dynamically using require().

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
const imagePath = 'logo.png';
return (
<div>
<img src={require(`./${imagePath}`).default} alt="Logo" />
</div>
);
};

export default MyComponent;
```

4. URL/Images from Backend:
   If your images are fetched from a backend API or database, you can render them using their URLs or base64 encoded strings.

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ imageURL }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={imageURL} alt="Dynamic Image" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

```

# 02.What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?

The useState() function returns an array with two elements:

State Value: The first element of the array is the current state value.
Setter Function: The second element is a function used to update the state value.
So, when you log useState() directly, you will see an array with the initial state value (which depends on what you pass as an argument to useState()) and a function to update that state.

```
[initialStateValue, function]
```

# 03.How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?

If you omit the dependency array ([]) in a useEffect hook, it will cause the effect to run on every render cycle. This essentially means the effect will execute both after the initial render and after every update to the component.

```
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect code here
});
```

This might lead to unintended consequences such as performance issues or infinite loops in certain scenarios, especially when the effect involves operations that update the component state or trigger re-rendering.

# 04. What is SPA?

SPA stands for Single Page Application. In React, a Single Page Application is a web application that operates within a single HTML page by dynamically updating that page in response to user interactions, without the need to reload the entire page from the server.

React is particularly well-suited for building SPAs due to its virtual DOM and efficient re-rendering mechanisms. SPAs built with React often involve:

1. Routing: React Router, a popular library, helps manage different "pages" or views within the application by enabling navigation without a full page reload. It allows developers to define different routes and render components based on those routes.

2. Component-Based Structure: React encourages a component-based architecture, breaking the UI into reusable components. Each component can manage its own state and interactions, which facilitates easier maintenance and scalability of the application.

3. State Management: React uses states and props to manage data flow. With the introduction of hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, managing state in functional components has become more straightforward.

4. Efficient Updates: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM by only re-rendering components that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page. This enhances performance and improves user experience.

Overall, SPAs in React provide a smoother and more responsive user experience by dynamically updating content while keeping the user within the same page context, eliminating the need for frequent full-page reloads.

# 05.What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?

| Properties   | Client-Side                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Server Side                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Execution    | In client-side routing, the routing logic and navigation happen within the user's browser using JavaScript.                                                                                                             | In server-side routing, the routing logic resides on the server. When a user requests a new page or route, the server processes the request and sends back an entirely new HTML page. |
| Page Changes | When a user interacts with the application, such as clicking a link or a button, JavaScript intercepts that action and updates the view by rendering different components or content without reloading the entire page. | Each navigation action triggers a request to the server for a new page. The server generates and sends back a fresh HTML page, causing a full page refresh.                           |
| Advantages   | Faster navigation,Smoother user experience,Easier handling of complex UI interactions                                                                                                                                   | SEO-friendly,Initial loading                                                                                                                                                          |

Differences:

- Performance: Client-side routing generally provides a faster and smoother user experience after the initial page load, while server-side routing can sometimes result in slower page changes due to full reloads.

- Initial Load: Server-side routing might have a faster initial load time as it sends complete HTML pages from the server, while client-side routing might have a slower initial load because it initially loads a single HTML file and fetches content as needed.

- SEO: Server-side routing is often considered more SEO-friendly because search engine crawlers can easily read and index HTML content sent from the server. However, client-side routing can be made SEO-friendly by implementing server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering techniques.
