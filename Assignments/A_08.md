# 01.How do you create Nested Routes `react-router-dom` cofiguration?

We need to import `RouterProvider`, `createBrowserRouter`, `Outlet` from `react-router-dom`
Nested Routes are created as shown below:

```
const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
const AppRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About name={"Albert"} />,
        children: [
          {
            path: "profile",
            element: <Profile />,
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
      {
        path: "/restaurants/:id",
        element: <RestaurantMenu />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<RouterProvider router={AppRouter} />);
```

Here `/about` route has a nested route with it when ever we call `/about/profile` it returns the profile component. Care must be taken that `<Outlet />` should be placed in the Parent Component where the Child component needs to be placed.

About component:

```
const About = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <h1>This is my learning Class ðŸš€</h1>
      <p>I am learning React </p>
    </>
  );
};
```

# 02. Read abt `createHashRouter`, `createMemoryRouter` from React Router docs.

`createHashRouter` is useful if you are unable to configure your web server to direct all traffic to your React Router application. Instead of using normal URLs, it will use the hash (#) portion of the URL to manage the "application URL".
Otherwise it functions similar to the `createBrowserRouter`.

Calling a sample route using HashRouter:
`localhost:1234/#/about`
Calling a sample router using BrowserRouter:
`localhost:1234/about`

`createMemoryRouter`: Instead of using the browser's history, a memory router manages its own history stack in memory. It's primarily useful for testing and component development tools like Storybook, but can also be used for running React Router in any non-browser environment.

# 03. What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class Based Components?

The Order of Life cycle method calls in Class Based Components is:

- constructor()
- render()
- ComponentDidMount
- ComponentDidUpdate
- ComponentWillUpdate

As seen below:<br>

# 04. Why do we use componentDidMount?

```
componentDidMount()
```

componentDidMount is the best place to call an API in your web application.
componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.
<br>
This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
<br>
You may call setState() immediately in componentDidMount(). It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render() will be called twice in this case, the user wonâ€™t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor() instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.

# 05. Why do we use componentWillUnmount? Show with example

`componentWillUnmount()`
componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount().

You should not call setState() in componentWillUnmount() because the component will never be re-rendered. Once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again.

Suppose that we have a time interval in render method of a component it will never clear the interval though you choose to click on a new link, since it is a single page application. To handle such kind of scenarios we'll need to clear the intervals otherwise lot's of computations and resources will e mishandled.

```
class About2 extends Component {
  // first class component:-Parent component
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log("Parent-Constructor");
    this.state = {
      name: this.props.name,
    };
  }
  render() {
    console.log("Parent-Render");
    // Child Component created for About and passing props from parent to child
    return (
      <>
        <h1>This is my learning Class ðŸš€</h1>
        <p>I am learning React </p>
      </>
    );
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // creating a time interval
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      console.log("Hello There!");
    }, 1000);
    console.log("Parent-ComponentDidMount");
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Clearing the interval when we go to a different component
    clearInterval(this.timer);
    console.log("Parent-Component Unmounted");
  }
}
```

# 06. Why do we use super(props) in constructor?

When super(props) is not written in the code, it will log an error on to the console specifying that we need to call a super constructor. This is because the child class will not be able to access the this keyowrd.
So to conclude, If we want to use this.props or simply this keyword inside the constructor, we need to pass the props coming from the parent class in super.

# 07. Why can't we have the callback function of `useEffect` async?

In React, the `useEffect` hook is designed to manage side effects in functional components. It allows you to perform actions after the component renders, mimicking lifecycle methods in class components.

The reason you can't make the callback function of `useEffect` itself async directly is related to how `useEffect` works. It expects a cleanup function or nothing to be returned from its callback.

When you make a function async, it returns a `Promise` implicitly. However, useEffect doesn't handle Promises directly in its return value.
