# 09 - Optimizing our App

# 01. When and why do we need `lazy()`?

In React,`lazy()` is used for Code Splitting/Chunking/On-Demand Loading/Lazy Loading/Dynamic Loading/Dynamic import.This feature was introduced to improve the performance of React applications by dynamically loading components only when they are needed, rather than loading all components upfront when the application starts.
When there are `n` number of components in your application, then you don't need to load them entirely at once. You can load the components only which you need as per the user navigation.

1. Performance Optimization:
   Loading all components at once can lead to longer initial load times, especially in larger applications with numerous components. By using lazy(), you can split your application into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary components when they're about to be rendered. This can significantly improve the initial loading speed.

2. Smaller Initial Bundle Size:
   Lazy loading reduces the initial bundle size of your application. Components that are not immediately needed are not included in the main bundle, allowing users to download only the essential parts of the application when they first load it.

When to Use lazy():<br>

```
- Large Applications: Especially beneficial for larger applications with many components, where loading everything upfront might degrade performance.
- Dynamic Routes: When dealing with routes and pages that are loaded based on user interaction or navigation, lazy loading helps in loading components on-demand.
```

Example:<br>

```
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# 02. What is suspense?

In React, Suspense is a component used for declarative code-splitting and handling asynchronous operations such as lazy loading of components and data fetching. It allows you to create better user experiences by specifying fallback content while components or data are being loaded asynchronously.
Example as above

# 03. Why we got this error: A component was suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix this, updates that suspend should be wrapped with start transition? How does suspense fix this error?

The error that we're referring to, "A component was suspended while responding to synchronous input," is encountered when we're using asynchronous operations or lazy loading (which might suspend rendering) while React is expecting synchronous updates.

React is designed to be synchronous by default, meaning that it expects updates to the UI to happen immediately during a synchronous render phase. However, when you introduce asynchronous behavior (like data fetching or lazy-loading components), React might encounter situations where it tries to perform an asynchronous task during a synchronous render, which isn't supported.

To handle this issue, React provides a solution using `startTransition`() in combination with `Suspense`.

How `startTransition`() and `Suspense` Fix This:
`startTransition`():
`startTransition`() is a function introduced in React that lets you mark a section of your code as non-urgent or as a low priority. It's a way of telling React that the upcoming state change or update isn't critical for the immediate rendering. This helps React batch updates and handle asynchronous tasks more effectively.

`Suspense`:
Suspense allows you to wrap the asynchronous or potentially suspending parts of your code, like lazy-loaded components or data fetching operations. It signals to React that this part of the code might suspend rendering while waiting for some data to resolve.

By combining `startTransition`() and `Suspense`, you can inform React about the non-critical nature of the update, allowing it to optimize rendering and potentially defer the rendering of the loading state to avoid interrupting synchronous updates.

```
import { startTransition, Suspense } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Perform asynchronous data fetching
    // ...
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    startTransition(() => {
      fetchData(); // Initiating an asynchronous task
      // Other synchronous updates
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Load Data</button>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* Lazy-loaded components or data-fetching components */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# 04. Advantages and Disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?

The decision to use code splitting heavily depends on the specific requirements of your application. In larger applications or applications targeting varied user bases (e.g., mobile and desktop), the benefits often outweigh the disadvantages. However, in smaller or less complex applications, the added complexity might not justify the gains in performance.

<h2>Advantages:</h2>
<b>Faster Initial Load Times:</b> By breaking down the code into smaller chunks and loading only what's necessary initially, code splitting reduces the initial load time of the application. Users get to see and interact with the essential parts of the app faster.

<b>Improved Performance:</b> Smaller initial bundle sizes result in faster parsing and execution by the browser. This leads to improved performance, especially on devices with limited resources or slower network connections.

<b>Optimized Bandwidth Usage:</b> Users only download the code they need, reducing bandwidth usage.

<b>Better User Experience:</b> Loading indicators or placeholders displayed during lazy loading and asynchronous data fetching through Suspense provide a more polished and seamless user experience, as users are informed about ongoing loading operations.

<h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
<b>Complexity in Development:</b> Code splitting introduces complexity into the development process, especially when managing multiple chunks, dependencies, and ensuring proper handling of async components or data. It might require additional tooling and expertise to manage effectively.

<b>Initial Render Delay:</b> While code splitting optimizes for subsequent loads, the initial render might experience a delay as the necessary chunks are fetched, which could lead to a brief loading time before the app becomes interactive.

<b>Debugging Challenges:</b> Splitting code can make debugging more challenging, as it might not be immediately evident which chunk or module caused a particular issue. This can add complexity to the debugging process.

# 05. When do we and why do we need suspense?

React's Suspense is primarily used in scenarios where you have asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or lazy-loading components, and you want to manage the loading state and fallback UI during these asynchronous tasks. Here are situations when and why you might need Suspense:

1. Lazy Loading Components:
   When to Use: In large applications where loading all components at once can impact performance, lazy loading with Suspense helps load components only when needed.
   Why Use: It improves initial load times by fetching components asynchronously and displaying a fallback UI until the component is ready to be rendered.
