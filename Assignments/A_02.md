# 2. Igniting our app: What have we learnt?

Creating our own react-app without actually using react-app.<br>

### Key Points:

Bundlers: Optimize the performance of our app to load it faster.
There are different bundlers for this task:
a. Vite
b. Parcel
c. Web Packs (used by create-react-app along with @Babel)

#### We'll be creating our own react-app by making use of Parcel(Bundler) package downloaded from the npm.

#### Functions of Parcel:

1. HMR: HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT (Similar Functionality of the Live Server)
2. File Watcher Algorithm - C++ (Tracks changes in the files)
3. Bundling (making it into a bundle kinda thing)
4. Minify (Reduces the long variable names)
5. Cleaning our Code (Clears the console log statements and such)
6. Dev & Production Build
7. Super Fast Build
8. Image Optimization (Such that the images load faster)
9. Caching while Development (Makes it faster)
10. Compression
11. Older versions of Browsers
12. Supports to build apps on https
13. Port Number is generated uniquely
14. Consistent Hashing Algorithm
15. Zero Config Bundler
