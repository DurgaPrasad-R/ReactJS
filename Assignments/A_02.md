# 2. Igniting our app: What have we learnt?

Creating our own react-app without actually using react-app.<br>

### Key Points:

Bundlers: A bundler is a tool that puts together all your JavaScript code and its dependencies and throws a new JavaScript output file with everything merged, ready for the web, commonly known as the bundle file.<br>
Optimize the performance of our app to load it faster.<br>
There are different bundlers for this task:
a. Vite
b. Parcel
c. Web Packs (used by create-react-app along with @Babel)

#### We'll be creating our own react-app by making use of Parcel(Bundler) package downloaded from the npm.

#### Functions of Parcel:

1. HMR: HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT (Similar Functionality of the Live Server)
2. File Watcher Algorithm - C++ (Tracks changes in the files)
3. Bundling (making it into a bundle kinda thing)
4. Minify (Reduces the long variable names)
5. Cleaning our Code (Clears the console log statements and such)
6. Dev & Production Build
7. Super Fast Build
8. Image Optimization (Such that the images load faster)
9. Caching while Development (Makes it faster)
10. Compression
11. Older versions of Browsers
12. Supports to build apps on https
13. Port Number is generated uniquely
14. Consistent Hashing Algorithm
15. Zero Config Bundler

# 01. What is npm?

npm is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.<br>

The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.<br>

npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.<br>

# 02. What is Parcel/WebPack? Why do we need it?

Parcel and WebPack are two different bundlers with each having their own functionality.<br>
A bundler is a tool that puts together all your JavaScript code and its dependencies and throws a new JavaScript output file with everything merged, ready for the web, commonly known as the bundle file.<br>
We need a bundler to optimize the performance of our web app that means the time taken for loading and stuff. If it is a small web application it is not an issue with loading but as we dive deep. We feel problematic with the time for loading.<br>
/dist will be the folder created after the bundle process and will contain all the bundled files.<br>

# 03. What is `.parcel-cache`?
The .cache folder (or .parcel-cache in parcel v2) stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode. I think committing it to git would be a bad idea - it would add a large number of (unnecessary) changes to your commit history, and it could easily get out-of-sync with the code that generated it.
